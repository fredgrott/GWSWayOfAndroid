# BackEnd Platforms

You picked up this book because you want ot learn how to make android applciation and make money for your family. At times that may require you to make a not-advanced-expert backend.

What you want is soemthing probably Javascript based that does nto handel everything advance but allows you to dynamically react to an andorid app request and deliver back what is requested.

These are those type of Javascrip backend providers:

Keep in mi9nd that those Javascript backends are not as feature rich and robust as other complicated backends. This is jsut so that you can boostrap now and when you need to change that backend later than you will change it to a more feature rich backend.
