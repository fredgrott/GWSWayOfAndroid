#Buying A Laptop


This is probably one of the most often asked questions from beginning Android devlopers as they just read the Google doc on what hardware the Android Emulators run on:





And, the Google Doc is confusing to new develeoprs as they are brand new to computer specs just as they are brand new to mobile device specs, mobile technology, etc.

This is where I chase away all that confusion. 

# CPU Hardware Optimization

CPU Hardware Optimization is a long word term that describes the technology CPUs use to 


On Intel CPUs this technology is called            and the following CPU families from Intel have this technology:

i7 and up
Atom

On AMD CPUs this technology is called        and the following CPU families from AMD have this technology:





The Google Android Emulators are designed for both of those CPU optimization technologies.

# SSD

Google does not directly state this but their Android Emulators with InstantRun enabled run best, speed performance wise on builds, with computer hardware that uses SSd for storage.



#What Intel Based Laptop to Buy

## Mac OSX

If you want to spend big bucks you can get a 15" Apple Laptop model with a 500gig SSD and the Google Emulators will run on those laptops with hardware potimization enabled. Apple Laptop models:

15" Air
15" 

Here in the USA that will run you about $3,000.

## MS WIndows OS


The best low cost buy is an ASUS ZenBook, which is a 15" laptop with 500gig SSD. Here in the USA they sell for $1200 or less.

#What AMD Based Laptop to Buy

The Google Android Emulators only allow hardware optimizatio on the Linux side of AMD cpu based machines, ie getting a MS Windowws based AMD laptop will not help you.


If you want to spend big bucks you can of course order a Linux based AMD laptop from Dell. My guess is that may not be an option for you.

## Linux OS


The Linux based AMD Laptop sellers in your price range are:







Same as for the MS WIndows or MAcIntel side in that you can decrease the price if you go to a 15" screen size and reduce the SSd storage to 500gigs.  Not a big deal as 1TB SDD external3.1 USB drives are about $200 and most laptops now come with USB3.1 ports in the first oplace.


If you got a low cost Linux laptop from a friend, you can still make it work by using a 3rd party x86 based images Android Emulator:

Just keep in mind that due to not having SSD storage and it being an older Linux AMd laptop you will havee to offset emulator perfaormance times. You can do that by switching from using Instrumented testing to plain Unittesting and Mocking.
