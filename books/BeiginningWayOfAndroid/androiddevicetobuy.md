#Android Device To Buy

This is another popular question among beginning android developers. Usually everyone wants a low cost one.

Most of you need to debug your Gestures to handle the new Samsung OEM form factor of the screen having an edge. The low cost economy model from Smasung that has that edge in the screen is the Galaxy line of android devices, specifically:

Samsung Galaxccy Grand Prime4G

Be careful, no matter what store you buy from they will list the microSDHC class 1O UHS-1 SdCard to pair with the device. You Do NOT WANT THAT ONE! 

The one you want is a SDHC/SDXC Class 3 UHS-II SDCard! Why? They are designed for video speeds and thus they are  at the performance speeds to store android apps on that you want to use as the Samung economy device only has 8gig memory. And the price on those tends to run as much as the low economy device price for the 32 gig versions, but you can pair that price down by maybe buying the 16gig version.
