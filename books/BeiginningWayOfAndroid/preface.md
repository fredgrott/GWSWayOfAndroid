# Preface


The Internet Platform changed everything from how we get jobs to how we shop. AND, of course, pursuing the American Dream also changed. I do not have all the answers, but it appears from leaders like Seth Godin, Gary Vaynerhuck, etc that OUR JOB is to pursue creating a SMALL Business or in what President Obama has called Business Starts.

This book is not about Computer Science, but it does use things created by computer Science in a quest to teach everyone android application development so that everyone can create a business around creating android applications. How far you take it, is up  to you! Are you up for the Challenge?

That being said, if you really want to get fluent in Android Native java Application programming than you must accept the challenge of using discipline and rigour in practicing your craft. 
That is you should be working the exeercises in each chapter and takign the example apps and chaning code to see what happens when the application runs.
