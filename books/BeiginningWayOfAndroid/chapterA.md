# Chapter A, Buying A Laptop and Android Phone

This is probably one of the most asked questions in the android developer forums online is what laptopto buy and what android phone  to buy among beiginning android developers.

To buy a laptop for android application development one should know what the Google Android emualtors use for hardware acceleration on both Intel and AMD cpus.

## Hardware Acceleration on Desktop CPUs

Google Docs make this hard, let's fix that!

Google Android Emulators Support:

Linux: Intel CPU with IntelVT-x, Intel EM64T and Executte Disable(XD) Bit support refers to Apple Macs and PCs.

Linux: AMD CPUs with AMD-V

NOTE: The Google Android Emulator uses KVM on Linux OSes, evidently Apple has it installed and configrued by default and most Linux OSes by default do not have it installed so you will have to do a manual install.

MS Windows: Intel i-CPUs with support for Intel VT-x, Intel EM64T, and Execute Disable(XD)Bit. So no Celeron or Atom processors.

NOTE: If you run Linux in a virtualized environment you do not have hardware acceleration. You need to be on bare metal if running Linux on both Intel suport CPUs and AMD supported CPUs.

## Laptop Recommendation

So here is how it goes, if you cannot get the laptops I recommend and have to go lower in price than you should consided using the 3rrd party Android Emulator providr Genymotion's x86-image-based Android emulators and of course switch to full UnitTesting in your TDD work flow to adjust for the lacluster performance in speedof the laptop you bought.

### Linux OS

There are several open-source OEM providers that provide a AMD powered laptop. The way to get the Laptop price down is to seek to buy a 15" screen size one that only has 500gig SSD of storage as 1TB extenral SSDs have come down in price and now are at abouot $175 in the USA.

And of course there are some OEM Sellers that focus on INTEL powered laptops with Linux already installed:

INTEL Laptop Linux POwered OEM Sellers:




### Apple OSX

The lower price solution to obtaining an Apple laptop that has SSD storage and hardware CPU acceleration is an Apple Air. Do not go lower than that as it only has an i5 ccpu as its slower than i7 cpus. Also, remember you can suppliment with an external 1TB SSD at about $175 per external SSD.


### MS Windows

On MS powered latops, the one to get currenlty is an ASUS ZenBook which is a  15" 500gig i7 Intel CPu powered laptop that is low cost about $1000.

## Android Phone To Buy

Some loow cost devices are the following:

### Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime4g

It runs about $175 in costs

### Kycera Hydra



### HTC




## SDCard To Buy for Android Phone

Since you will storing your lauchable app son the SdCard it is important to get an SDCard that supports the faster memory bus speeds in the Android Phone you just bought.

You want the SDCard that support video speeds as that is fast enough to store lauchable apps on the SDCard. WEhich means you want a SDHC/SDXC Class 3 UHS-II SDCard. 

To get that SDCArd at say 32gig will cost the same amount as you paid for your Android Device. If yoru budget is tight just go down to the 16gig size or the 8gig size to adjust theprice downward.
